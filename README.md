## Installation
1. Clone the repo (https://github.com/jroller33/Team-Profile-Generator.git)
2. Run `npm i` and then `node index.js` to start.

## Usage
After you start the app, you will be asked a series of questions about the employees on your team. First you'll be asked for the manager's info. Then you'll be given a list of options to add additional employees. You can add as many employees as you need and they will be dynamically added to the HTML file. You'll be prompted to enter each employee's information. Once you're done entering all the employees select "Finish Team" and the HTML will be created in ./dist/
